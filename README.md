# Convex Hull

## Project Requirements
Final research project for the graduate-level class, Algorithm Design and Analysis. 
* The topic should be related to algorithm complexity and must involve implementing one or more algorithms or data structures.
* After completing their research, students are responsible for writing a 7-10 page paper which is to be submitted along with their source code.

## Topic
Implement convex hull algorithms, which will include:
* Graham's scan
* Jarvis's March (Gift-Wrapping)

To implement in future work:
* _Divide-and-conquer_
* _Prune-and-search_
* _Chan's algorithm_

Compare the performance of each algorithm implemented, and create some visual representation (i.e. scatter plots) of the algorithms/performance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things were needed to set up the development environment and how to install them.
_Note: installation instructions based on macOS Mojave._

* [Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#module-matplotlib.pyplot)

Install pip:
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/gpython get-pip.pyet-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```
```
python get-pip.py
```

Install matplotlib:
```
pip install matplotlib
``` 

### Run

After installing any prerequisites listed above, follow these steps to run the program:

1. Clone the project to your local machine.<br>

    `git clone https://github.com/carissaallen/convex-hull.git`

2. From your terminal, enter the following command: <br>

    `python main.py`

### Hull Construction

To view the construction of the convex hull:
* Naviate to the _main.py_ file. In the `main` method:
* If `show_progress = False` then the scatter plot will only display the final convex hull boundary.
* If `show_progress = True` then the scatter plot will show the hull's progress as the boundary is constructed. <br>

  _Note: keep the input size small, this is pretty slow._ :turtle:
