# Convex Hull

## Project Requirements
Final research project for the graduate-level class, Algorithm Design and Analysis. 
* The topic should be related to algorithm complexity and must involve implementing one or more algorithms or data structures.
* After completing their research, students are responsible for writing a 7-10 page paper which is to be submitted along with their source code.

## Topic
Implement several convex hull algorithms, which will include:
* Graham's scan
* Divide-and-conquer
* Prune-and-search

Compare the performance of each algorithm implemented, and create some visual representation of the algorithms/performance
